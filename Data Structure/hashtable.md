Hash Map / hash table 
key -value structure , really fast to loop up (o(1)) to search ,delete , add 

Using hash function -> put the result as the key.


hash function 

 collision :
you can still put it in the same space in the list.
and use linear search (linear serach (o(n))) if collision happend. 



//In javascript 

we can use following 3 ways to implement the hashmap

1) use set
2) use map
3) use object


1) use set
alway only storing the 


2)use map
storing the key value
